# Most.js Koans

The [Most.js](https://github.com/cujojs/most) Koans are a fun and easy way to
get started this awesome reactive programming toolkit. No experience assumed or
required. Just follow the instruction below to start making tests pass!

### Getting Started

The koans are broken out into areas by file, events are covered in
`05_events.js`, time is introduced in `04_time.js`, etc. The are presented in
order in the `index.js` file.

### Installing

In order to run the koans you need [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed. If
you do not already have Node set up, please [visit the website](https://nodejs.org/) to install Node.js.

To verify your installation, in your terminal window simply type:
```bash
$ node --version
```

### The Path to Enlightement

You can run the tests by calling `npm test` at your terminal window.
```bash
~/projects/github/most-koans $ npm test
```

### Red, Green, Refactor

In test-driven development (TDD) the mantra has always been red: write a failing test and run it, green: make the test pass, and refactor: look at the code and see if you can make it any better.

With the koans, you will need to run the tests and see it fail (red), make the test pass (green), then take a moment and reflect upon the test to see what it is teaching you and improve the code to better communicate its intent (refactor).
